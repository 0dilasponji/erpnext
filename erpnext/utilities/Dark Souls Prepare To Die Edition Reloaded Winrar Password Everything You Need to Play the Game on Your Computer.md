Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition is a game that will test your skills, patience and perseverance. It is set in a dark fantasy world of Lordran, where you play as a cursed undead who must find a way to break the cycle of fire and darkness. You will explore vast and interconnected areas, fight against deadly enemies and bosses, and collect various items and equipment that will help you survive. You will also encounter other players online, who can either help you or hinder you in your quest.
 
The game is known for its high difficulty level and unforgiving nature. You will die many times, and each death will cost you some of your souls and humanity, which are the main currencies in the game. You will also lose your progress and respawn at the last bonfire you rested at, which are the checkpoints in the game. However, dying is not the end, but rather a learning experience. You can recover your lost souls and humanity if you reach the spot where you died without dying again. You can also use your humanity to restore your human form, which allows you to summon other players for co-op or be invaded by them for PvP. You can also use your humanity to kindle bonfires, which increases the amount of Estus Flasks you can carry, which are the main healing items in the game.
 
The game also features a deep and complex lore that is mostly hidden and implied. You will have to piece together the story and the history of the world from item descriptions, NPC dialogues, environmental clues and your own interpretation. The game does not hold your hand or guide you through a linear path. You have the freedom to explore and discover the secrets of Lordran at your own pace and order. You can also choose to join different covenants, which are factions that have their own goals and rewards. You can also influence the outcome of the game by making certain choices or actions.
 
Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition is a game that will challenge you, reward you and immerse you in a rich and mysterious world. It is a game that will make you feel proud of your achievements and humble by your failures. It is a game that will make you appreciate every victory and learn from every defeat. It is a game that will make you prepare to die.
