Mac OS X 10.6.7 Snow Leopard is an operating system developed by Apple for Intel-based Mac computers. It was released in 2011 and included several improvements and bug fixes over the previous versions of Snow Leopard. However, the official installation DVD for Mac OS X 10.6.7 is a dual layer disc, which means it requires a dual layer DVD drive and a dual layer DVD to burn it. This can be a problem for some users who have older Macs or don't have access to dual layer DVDs.
 
Fortunately, there is a way to install Mac OS X 10.6.7 Snow Leopard on a single layer DVD, by removing some unnecessary files from the original image. This tutorial will show you how to do that using a free software called Monolingual and a tool called Disk Utility.

## Step 1: Download Monolingual and Mac OS X 10.6.7 DVD Image
 
Monolingual is a program that allows you to remove unwanted languages and architectures from your Mac OS X installation. You can download it from [here](https://ingmarstein.github.io/Monolingual/). You will also need to download the Mac OS X 10.6.7 DVD image from [here](https://archive.org/details/osx-10.6.7-dvd). This is a free download from the Internet Archive, but you should only use it if you own a legitimate copy of Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard.
 
## Step 2: Mount the Mac OS X 10.6.7 DVD Image
 
Once you have downloaded both files, double-click on the Mac OS X 10.6.7 DVD image file to mount it on your desktop. You should see a disc icon with the label "Mac OS X Install DVD".
 
## Step 3: Run Monolingual and Remove Unwanted Files
 
Launch Monolingual and click on the "Languages" tab. You will see a list of languages that are included in the Mac OS X installation. Uncheck all the languages that you don't need, leaving only English checked. Then click on the "Remove" button at the bottom right corner of the window.

Next, click on the "Architectures" tab. You will see a list of architectures that are supported by Mac OS X, such as Intel, PowerPC, etc. Uncheck all the architectures that are not compatible with your Mac, leaving only Intel checked (or PowerPC if you have an older Mac). Then click on the "Remove" button again.
 
Monolingual will ask you to select a folder to process. Choose the mounted Mac OS X Install DVD from your desktop and click "Open". Monolingual will start removing the unwanted files from the DVD image, which may take some time depending on your computer speed.
 
## Step 4: Create a New DVD Image with Disk Utility
 
When Monolingual is done, quit the program and open Disk Utility from your Applications folder. In Disk Utility, select the mounted Mac OS X Install DVD from the left sidebar and click on the "New Image" button at the top toolbar.
 
A window will pop up asking you to name and save your new DVD image file. Choose a name and location for your file and make sure to select "DVD/CD master" as the image format and "none" as the encryption option. Then click "Save". Disk Utility will create a new DVD image file based on the modified Mac OS X Install DVD.
 
## Step 5: Burn the New DVD Image to a Single Layer DVD
 
When Disk Utility is done, eject the original Mac OS X Install DVD from your desktop and insert a blank single layer DVD into your drive. Then select the new DVD image file that you created in Disk Utility and click on the "Burn" button at the top toolbar.
 
A window will pop up asking you to confirm burning the image to the disc. Click "Burn" again and wait for Disk Utility to finish burning your new single layer Mac OS X 10.6.7 Snow Leopard installation DVD.
