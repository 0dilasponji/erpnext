If you are curious about the plot of the graphic novel, here is a brief summary. Nora Grey is a normal teenager who lives with her mother in Coldwater, Maine. She has a best friend named Vee and a crush on Elliot, a new transfer student. However, her life changes when she meets Patch, a mysterious and attractive senior who is assigned as her biology partner. Patch seems to know everything about her and has a way of getting under her skin. Nora soon discovers that Patch is not human, but a fallen angel who wants to become human by killing her. However, he also has feelings for her and tries to protect her from other dangers. Nora has to decide whether to trust Patch or to stay away from him.
 
The graphic novel follows the same storyline as the original novel, but with some changes and additions. For example, the graphic novel includes a prologue that shows Patch's fall from heaven and his encounter with Dabria, his former lover and guardian angel. The graphic novel also adds some scenes that were not in the novel, such as Nora's visit to the cemetery with Vee and Elliot, and Patch's fight with Jules at the motel. The graphic novel also omits some details and characters that were in the novel, such as Nora's father's death and Chauncey Langeais.
 
The graphic novel has a different style and tone than the novel. The illustrations are dark and realistic, with a lot of shadows and contrasts. The colors are mostly black, white, gray, and red, creating a gloomy and suspenseful atmosphere. The dialogue is also more concise and direct than the novel, with less narration and description. The graphic novel focuses more on the action and the romance than the mystery and the backstory.
